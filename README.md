- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual bug!
  In 1947, a team of computer scientists found a moth trapped in the relay of a Harvard Mark II computer, which was causing an error.
  This incident was logged as the "first actual case of bug being found,"
  and that's how the term "debugging" came to be associated with fixing software errors.
